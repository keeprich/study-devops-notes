This section of the workbook is designed to help you understand what is meant by the
term ‘learning disabilities’ and how best to support individuals with learning disabilities.
You will learn about how individuals with learning disabilities have been treated in the
past and how this has affected how they are treated today. You will also learn about
the major changes that have taken place in recent years, which have seen the ending
of segregation as a public policy and an increasing emphasis on helping individuals with
learning disabilities achieve equality, empowerment and independence.
What we mean by ‘learning disability’
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 1.
The term ‘learning disability’ is used when someone has more difficulty than most
people in understanding new or complicated information or in learning new skills,
and a reduced ability to cope independently in everyday life. There are different
causes of learning disabilities, for example, brain damage sustained during birth or
an inherited genetic condition, but all individuals will have developed their disabilities
before reaching adulthood and will have them for life. The language used to describe
individuals who have learning disabilities has often been hurtful and disrespectful
towards them and is a very sensitive issue. Later in this module, we will look at
the effect of the language used. It used to be common for individuals with learning
disabilities to be described as mentally handicapped but this is no longer acceptable.
In England, around 1.2 million individuals are known to have learning disabilities but
the term covers a very wide range or spectrum, ranging from those whose disability
has comparatively little effect on their lives to those who need support and assistance
with every aspect of their daily living.
Having the label ‘learning disabilities’ can be helpful in enabling individuals to obtain
the health and social care services they need, and will provide individuals with
protection from discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. Where individuals have
not been identified as having learning disabilities, they can sometimes miss out on
services which would benefit them.
To help ensure that individuals have the support they require, health and social care
professionals break down the spectrum of learning disabilities into four groups.
5
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
The spectrum of learning disabilities
Mild Learning Disabilities
Most individuals with learning disabilities (80%) fall into this category. Many go
through life fairly independently and may only need help from social services or the
NHS in the event of a crisis. They may benefit from additional help to access housing
or employment but many will cope well enough without any help from social services.
Moderate Learning Disabilities
12% of individuals with learning disabilities are said to have a moderate level of
disability. This means that they may need support with everyday tasks such as dealing
with their money, paying bills and perhaps with personal hygiene. On the other hand,
they are quite likely to be able to go out by themselves and may have a job. They will
probably be able to communicate in words, although they may only have a limited range
of words.
Severe Learning Disabilities
This is a smaller group (7%). Individuals are likely to need quite a lot of support with
their personal care, in social activities and in communicating with people who they do
not know.
Profound Learning Disabilities
Only 1% of individuals with learning disabilities are considered to fall into this
category. They are likely to be very dependent on others for personal care and other
essential needs. They will often not be able to communicate using words but may
be able to do so by signing, electronic communication boards or by pointing (object
referencing). Many will have additional health complications or impairments such as
epilepsy, physical disabilities or sensory impairments.

Why do individuals have learning disabilities?
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 2 and 3.
Learning disabilities can have a variety of causes but what everyone with learning
disabilities has in common is that they acquired their disabilities at or prior to birth
or in childhood.
Learning disabilities acquired before birth
An unborn child (foetus) can be affected by substances such as medicines, alcohol or
drugs transferred from the bloodstream of the mother to the unborn child through the
placenta. Damage to the unborn child can also be caused by exposure of the mother
to radiation or toxic chemicals.
Another cause is a genetic condition inherited from either parent or caused by a faulty
or missing gene. Down’s syndrome is the most common genetic cause of a learning
disability and perhaps the best known. Individuals with Down’s syndrome have an
extra copy of chromosome 21, which results in a distinctive appearance as well as
learning disability. Some individuals who have Down’s syndrome can be susceptible
to heart defects and a range of other physical problems. The Down’s Syndrome
Association estimates that the condition affects 1 in every 1,000 babies born in the
UK. Down’s syndrome can be an inherited condition but more often occurs by chance.
Unlike Down’s syndrome, individuals with Fragile X syndrome have the correct number
of chromosomes but have a faulty gene on their X chromosome. Boys with Fragile X
syndrome are likely to be more severely affected. The severity of the individual’s learning
disability will depend upon the degree of damage to the faulty gene. This is an inherited
condition.
Other genetic conditions include:
Phenylketonuria (PKU)
This condition occurs because the individual’s body is unable to break down
phenylalanine, a substance which is found in protein. As a result of this, the level
of phenylalanine builds up and although at first there are no harmful effects, if left
untreated the child will develop severe learning disabilities. All babies born in the UK
are now given a simple blood test to detect PKU. If given a special low-protein diet and
an amino acid supplement from infancy, they should remain healthy and should not
develop learning disabilities. PKU affects 1 in every 10,000 babies born in the UK and
is the result of an inherited faulty gene.
7
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)
PWS is a rare genetic disorder caused by a fault in the individual’s chromosomes and
happens purely by chance. There appear to be no specific causes and the disorder
affects 1 in every 15,000 babies born in the UK. Individuals with PWS have learning
disabilities, restricted growth, reduced muscle tone and often have a constant desire
to eat which can lead to them becoming dangerously overweight.
Angelman syndrome
This is a genetic disorder affecting 1 in every 25,000 people. Children with Angelman
syndrome will experience severe developmental delay, speech problems and
coordination and balance problems.
Learning disabilities acquired during and after birth (within the first
28 days of life)
Although modern healthcare has reduced the risk of difficulties occurring during the
birth of a child, sadly these dangers cannot be eliminated completely. Complications
can occur at birth, such as when with a baby is in the breech (reverse) position.
This and other difficulties can delay the period of giving birth, leading to the mother
becoming exhausted and the baby becoming physically distressed, increasing the risk
of trauma or harm to the baby.
Sometimes, the umbilical cord, which carries nutrients to the baby whilst in the
womb, can become wrapped around the baby’s neck before or during the process of
birth; this can result in the baby being starved of oxygen. This is known as asphyxia
and can result in damage to the baby’s brain, causing learning disabilities.
Learning disabilities acquired during childhood
It may not always be clear whether or not a baby has a learning disability. This may
only gradually become apparent as the child grows older and perhaps is slow to meet
important stages in their development, known as ‘milestones’, for example, crawling,
learning to walk or speaking.
Mild learning disabilities may be difficult to diagnose because it is often only when the
child begins to mix and interact with others that it becomes clear that he or she is not
as able as their peers.
Workbook 1
8
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
Sometimes, the child’s mother feels instinctively that something is wrong, perhaps by
comparing their progress with that of older siblings, but sometimes there may not be
a formal diagnosis for several years.
Meningitis and other infections in early years can also contribute to the onset of
learning disabilities, by causing damage to the brain, although strictly speaking this
should be classified as Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) as opposed to learning disability.
Poor diet and lack of stimulation from parents and others can also lead to a failure to
meet developmental targets and can contribute to learning disability.
There are also many individuals for whom the cause of their learning disability is
never known. According to the British Institute for Learning Disabilities, this is the
case for around 50% of individuals with mild learning disabilities. For individuals
with severe or profound learning disabilities, the causes are usually clearer and the
proportion for whom the cause is not known falls to a quarter (25%).
The impact on the family of having a member with a
learning disability
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 4a and 4b.
Ultrasound scans and other checks during pregnancy may give an indication that the
unborn child has a condition which could cause a learning disability and a test of the
amniotic fluid which surrounds the baby in the womb, amniocentesis, may confirm
that the baby has an inherited condition such as Down’s syndrome. However, in many
cases it only becomes clear that the baby has a disability after birth.
The reaction of parents and other members of the family to the news that a child
has a learning disability can vary enormously. Parents will have their own hopes and
dreams for their child and the diagnosis can cause feelings often associated with
grief: shock, disbelief, anger and guilt. Others may deny that their child has a learning
disability or may blame themselves.
Parents who suspect that their child has a learning disability may feel frustrated if this
is not accepted by health professionals and may feel that they have to fight to ensure
that they and their child obtain the help they need.
Having a family member with a learning disability also has an effect on other
members of the family. Brothers and sisters may love their sibling but can sometimes
resent the extra attention the child needs which will mean that they themselves may
receive less attention or may need to take on more responsibilities. They may not
understand why their brother or sister is unable to do certain things or behaves in a
particular way. Sometimes, at school, they may also be the victim of bullying because
they have a disabled sibling. Siblings may also mimic the behaviour of the individual
with a learning disability, leading parents to believe that they also have problems.
© LCG 2018
Grandparents may also have difficulty coming to terms with the child’s learning
disability, as they too will have had hopes for a different kind of future for their
grandchild. They may also have grown up with a view that individuals with learning
disabilities should lead separate lives with limited expectations, a view which is now
changing in society as a whole but which can be difficult to adjust from. The view
often expressed in the past, that couples should have their disabled baby ‘put away’
and try for another ‘normal’ child, can be hard to disregard for people brought up
when these views were common.
Even if families remain positive, a diagnosis of learning disability does bring with it
worries about the child’s future care and support. Will he or she manage in mainstream
school? Will they need any additional support at school? If they have additional
healthcare needs, will the family have the support and equipment they need to look
after them? What will happen during the transition from childhood to adulthood? Will
the child ever be able to live independently? Will they be able to find and hold down a
job? Finally, what will happen when the parents are no longer able to look after them?
Hannah’s story
Hannah was our first baby and she seemed fine when she was born. As she
grew though, we noticed that she wasn’t really keeping up with children of the
same age. She was late walking, late talking and late doing everything really.
It was when she started school that it became obvious. She had difficulty
with reading, communication and numbers. They told us she had moderate
learning difficulties. The thing we worry about most is when we’re not here any
more to take care of her.
Different approaches to disability – the social and
medical models
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 5a and 5b.
Models of disability are ways which have been put forward to help understand the
nature of disability. Until recently, the most common view of disability was the
medical model. In this model, the individual is regarded as disabled because of the
inability of the individual’s body to function correctly due to injury, illness or inherited
or genetic characteristics. Under the medical model, the fact that an individual’s body
cannot function correctly is the main reason why the individual is ‘disabled’ and not
able to take a full part in society.

individuals with learning disabilities
Workbook 1

Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
The social model of disability looks at things very differently. The social model
sees the physical limitations an individual may have, for example, an inability to walk
unaided, as a result of the way society is organised. The impairment may make it
difficult for the individual to take a full part in the community but, if adjustments
can be made to the way society is organised, the individual should no longer be
disadvantaged or disabled.
These adjustments can be physical and relate to the way buildings and equipment are
constructed but can also be related to the way that the non-disabled population see
individuals with disabilities.
For example, an individual who uses a walking frame is considered to have impaired
mobility but if ramps, lifts and other physical adjustments are provided, they can
achieve independence which will help their self-esteem and help others to see them
in a positive way.
The social model suggests that the real reason why individuals are considered
disabled is because the community has not made all the adjustments it can to
allow for their impairment and allow them to be included. If buildings and services
are planned with the needs of both disabled and non-disabled individuals in mind,
disabled individuals would be better able to take part in society. Very often, the
adjustments made for disabled people help everyone’s access, not just those
with disabilities; for this reason, it is more accurate to speak of accessible toilets,
entrances, exits, etc. rather than describe them as ‘disabled’.
The same principle applies to information and the words used in publications,
signs and notices. If information is written in a straightforward and accessible way,
individuals with a learning disability are often able to take part on an equal footing
to non-disabled people. Improving physical access for people with disabilities can
also make things easier for non-disabled people. As with improving physical access,
making documents easier to understand will benefit everyone, not just individuals with
learning disabilities.
Did you know?
Many government documents are published in an accessible format with a
larger font than usual and using simplified language. They are often available
as audio recordings for individuals who cannot read or have impaired vision.
For example, the following is an easy read guide to the Equality Act 2010
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/
attachment_data/file/85039/easy-read.pdf
For those who do not use words to communicate, the inclusion of pictures and
symbols can also make information more accessible.

individuals with learning disabilities
The history of services for individuals with learning
disabilities
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 6a.
Long-stay hospitals
The medical model view of disability resulted in a belief that the proper place for
individuals with disabilities or long-term mental health problems was in long-stay
hospitals where they could be looked after or ‘treated’. For this reason, many
individuals lived in hospitals of this type rather than in the community, resulting in
being isolated from the general population. This was not helped by the fact that the
hospitals themselves were often in the countryside, largely self-sufficient, with food
from their own farms and employment for residents (or ‘inmates’ as they were often
called).
Until Parliament passed the 1913 Mental Deficiency Act, individuals with learning
disabilities often lived in workhouses or lunatic asylums, but the Act allowed for
the setting up of specific long-stay institutions for them. The Mental Deficiency Act
identified four categories of individuals which it described as:
idiots
imbeciles
the feeble minded
moral defectives
Using this kind of language to describe individuals with learning disabilities is quite
rightly not acceptable today. The Mental Deficiency Act led to the setting up of new
hospitals for individuals with learning disabilities throughout the country; for example,
three were opened in the Bristol area in 1916 and 1917. It was assumed that
residents would never have the opportunities which the general population enjoyed, but
for the more able individuals, there was the possibility of work within the institutions.
Did you know?
A brochure from the early 1900s for one of the Bristol hospitals said, ‘Mentally
defective persons never acquire self-control or become fit to cope on equal
terms with normal people’. However, it did go on to say that, ‘They can be
improved by training, taught to do many useful things, and under careful
supervision, even succeed in partially earning their own livelihood’.
Workbook 1
12
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
It was common for individuals with learning disabilities to be described as ‘retarded’ or
‘mentally handicapped’ and this kind of language was still used by some people until
just a few decades ago. Many of the large hospitals had as many as 1,500 beds and
there were instances of single wards of 100 or more beds. From the 1930s onwards,
another wave of purpose-built ‘colonies’ for individuals with learning disabilities went
on to be built in rural areas around the country. Once again, it is hard to imagine a
word like ‘colonies’ being used today in relation to groups of individuals with learning
disabilities. These hospitals could be quite remote, and partly for this reason had their
own staff accommodation and were large local employers, with generations of the
same families working in the institutions.
The more able residents often worked in the laundries and workshops of the hospitals
or as porters. They were often described as ‘high grades’ indicating that they had a
higher level of ability than the ‘low grades’ who were more impaired.
Sometimes, individuals were labelled as having ‘mental deficiencies’ or being
‘mentally handicapped’, even if they only had a mild learning disability, and in some
cases none. Difficult behaviour during childhood and teenage years could lead to
eventual admission to a long-stay hospital. It was not uncommon for teenage girls
with learning disabilities who became pregnant to be admitted to a long-stay hospital
and for the child to be taken for adoption.
Large wards tended to mean a lack of supervision and this could result in residents
developing institutional behaviour such as stealing food from the plates of others.
Years after the hospitals had closed, residents who now lived in care homes could still
be found bolting down their food and risking choking because this is what they had
learned to do in the hospitals, to prevent their food from being stolen.
Lack of private space was another issue in the long-stay hospitals. Residents usually
slept in dormitories with others and would have been unlikely to have had their own
rooms. Towards the end of the hospitals’ existence, cubicles were created using
curtains and bedroom furniture, which at least gave a little privacy, although offered
no protection against noise. Bathrooms were often communal and open plan without
private areas for washing.
Another aspect of the hospital system was that for many years, it was common
for there to be separate hospitals or colonies for men and women. This meant
that opportunities to form a relationship with the opposite sex were limited or nonexistent. There is evidence that this separation was a deliberate policy of discouraging
individuals with disabilities from having children; this meant that many individuals who
were desperate for relationships and children were simply denied the opportunity.
Although some families kept in touch, it was not uncommon for individuals with
learning disabilities to be moved to a hospital in another part of the country and for
family ties to be broken.

Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
At the same time that adults with learning disabilities were living in hospitals, children
with disabilities were rarely in mainstream schools but educated instead in ‘special
schools’.
Community living
Ideas around inclusivity developed from the 1970s onwards. People started to believe
that individuals with learning disabilities should be encouraged to develop ordinary
lives with the roles and duties that most people have. This view was advanced by
Wolfensburger with his theories of Normalisation and Social Role Valorization.
Later, John O’Brien developed his Five Service Accomplishments which were very
influential on the development of new kinds of person-centred services – services
built to suit the individual’s needs rather than ones which the individual would need
to fit into. The Five Accomplishments encouraged organisations providing services for
individuals with learning disabilities to ask themselves whether they:
1) Provided real and informed choice to individuals receiving the service and the
right to make the major decisions relating to their lives.
2) Encouraged the individual to grow in competence and experience in relation to
work and leisure activities.
3) Enabled individuals to be treated with the same respect as those without learning
disabilities and to be valued members of society.
4) Enabled individuals with learning disabilities to have real community presence
and access to mainstream rather than segregated services and facilities.
5) Enabled individuals with learning disabilities to develop community participation,
enabling them to make meaningful relationships and connections in their
community.
As a result of these and other ideas, it became more common to see individuals with
learning disabilities in the community. Meanwhile, in education, there was a growing
movement to integrate young people with learning disabilities into mainstream
schools, sometimes with support from their own classroom assistant.

Community homes
As the long-stay institutions closed, many of their former residents moved to care
homes in the community. These were intended to be ordinary houses in residential
areas close to shops and other facilities and were designed to help the individuals
who lived there take a full part in their local community. They were usually home to
no more than five or six individuals and were quite successful in their aim of helping
individuals to become more independent. They were an improvement on the hospital
system and provided good solutions for many individuals but were not the answer for
all. Sometimes individuals who lived in the homes had little choice who they lived with,
and living in any group requires compromise, which can mean that not everyone’s
needs can be satisfied. Research in the mid-1990s by the Tizzard Centre at the
University of Kent showed that after a few years of moving to a community home,
most individuals with learning disabilities made little further progress in developing
independent living skills.
In 2001, the government’s White Paper ‘Valuing People’ set out the government’s
policy to give individuals with learning disabilities greater choice and control over their
lives and improved healthcare.
It has been fairly common for individuals with learning disabilities to continue to live
with their parents after they reach adulthood and often to remain there until their
parents find that they are too old or infirm to look after them. If the individual has
been encouraged to develop independent living skills, supported living might be an
option at this stage, but often they will move to residential care.
Supported living
An alternative approach to community homes has been to set up Supported Living
Schemes. These schemes enable individuals with learning disabilities to live more
independently in their own flats or houses, with different levels of staff support
according to their needs.
The amount of support provided can vary enormously, from just a few hours per week
to full-time, depending on needs. Sometimes individuals may receive support from
more than one agency; for example, one agency might be responsible for providing
help with managing finances and paying rent whilst another might provide personal
care. The packages of care that individuals receive vary greatly but what they should
all have in common is that services are designed with the needs of the individual in
mind, rather than expecting them to fit into an existing service.
14
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
Shared Lives
Shared Lives is an alternative to care homes and supported living. Shared Lives
Schemes used to be known as Adult Placement Schemes and involve the individual
with learning disabilities moving in with a Shared Lives carer and becoming a member
of their family home. An alternative approach can be for the individual to become a
regular daytime or overnight visitor to the carer’s home. Around 12,000 individuals
use Shared Lives services in the UK and carers are recruited, vetted and trained under
local Shared Lives Schemes and monitored by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
Carers are paid to compensate for their time and expenses and individuals using the
service are able to participate in an ordinary household and have the opportunity to
get to know the individual’s family and friends.
More information about Shared Lives is available on the website for Shared Lives Plus
http://www.sharedlivesplus.org.uk.
Direct payments
Since 2007, successive governments have had policies that design services
around the individual, known as the ‘Personalisation Agenda’. Under the Care Act
2014, which came into force in April 2015, local authorities have a duty to involve
individuals who use their services, including individuals with learning disabilities, in
designing and commissioning a varied range of services.
Did you know?
Personalisation means offering a mix of services that specifically meet the
needs of an individual.
Over the same period, it became more common for individuals with disabilities,
including learning disabilities, to have their funding paid directly to them to enable
them to employ their own support or to buy specific services. As an alternative to
employing and managing their own staff, some individuals prefer to use an agency to
employ and manage staff on their behalf.
Take up of the opportunities that personal budgets and direct payments provide has
varied; however, it is hoped that the new duties given to local authorities by the Care
Act may increase the pace of change. The Care Act gave local authorities a duty to
assess the needs of individuals with learning disabilities, to provide each with a care
and support plan and also to offer them a personal budget.

In 2015, the NHS, Local Government, Department for Health and other health and
care bodies produced the report:
‘Transforming Care for People with Learning Disabilities – Next Steps’
This sets out an action plan for the work to be done to improve services for individuals
with learning disabilities, focusing on empowering the individual, providing the right
sort of care in the right place for the individual, developing and improving the care
workforce involved in caring for those with learning disabilities, ensuring care for
individuals is properly regulated and producing regular data to ensure all these goals
are being met.
How past ways of working can influence how individuals
with learning disabilities receive services in the present-day
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 6b.
As you have seen, in the past, individuals with learning disabilities were feared and
excluded from society. They were treated as being unable to live normal lives and
be part of wider society. Whilst much has been done to try and make society more
inclusive, these attitudes persist and may still affect services today.
Today, individuals with learning disabilities should have access to personalised support
to live as independently as possible. However, there are still some examples where
individuals are denied their rights. Cases such as Winterbourne View Hospital (2011)
show that there are still services that fail to treat individuals as individuals and where
they can suffer abuse and neglect because their human rights are not respected.
Care workers may act in this way for a variety of reasons. These include:
• Some people resist change because they are worried by it or don’t think they can
work in new ways e.g. person-centred care.
• Some people will always work in ways that make their jobs easier and this may
incorporate bad practices from the past.
• Some people will still hold old-fashioned views about mental health, perhaps
believing that individuals won’t understand what is happening to them anyway.
Individuals should be encouraged to make their own decisions, with support where
required, and be offered personalised services, but in many areas this does not
happen and individuals still become segregated from society.

Key changes in relation to individuals with learning
disabilities
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 7a and 7b.
Increasingly, it is accepted that individuals with learning disabilities want the same
things as other people, such as:
a home of their own
meaningful daytime activities
a job
close personal relationships
a family
There is now much more choice available for individuals with learning disabilities. The
government’s personalisation agenda enables individuals to live more independently,
with agencies providing a range of support including personal care if this is needed. It
is also possible for individuals to receive direct payments to employ their own support
staff rather than having to go through staffing agencies.
Where individuals live
Individuals are able to live in homes of their own or in the family home with support
provided at home, rather than living in care homes, psychiatric units, or communities
of individuals with learning disabilities.
Daytime activities
There has been a move away from council-run day centres to a much more flexible
use of the money, to purchase a far wider range of services and activities. These
could include funding to enable individuals to take part in a sports session at a local
leisure centre or even dog walking.
Employment
It can be hard for anyone to find work, but it is particularly difficult for individuals with
learning disabilities because of attitudes of some employers towards individuals and
due to individuals’ level of skills, meaning that there may be a limited range of jobs
open to them.
Workbook 1 17
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
Did you know?
Despite some improvements, the number of adults with learning disabilities in
paid employment is not high; just under 6% in 2015.
The kind of jobs taken up by individuals with learning disabilities tend to be unskilled
and, more often than not, behind the scenes and out of the public eye. For example,
when working for a supermarket, it would be more common for someone with a
learning disability to work in the stock room rather than in the store with customers,
filling shelves or on the checkouts.
On the whole, although work opportunities may be difficult to find, there is now
a wider range of work-related opportunities available to individuals with learning
disabilities.
Sexual relationships and parenthood
Article 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is the right of men and women over 16 ‘to
marry and found a family’. This applies to everyone, including individuals with learning
disabilities. However, given that many individuals with learning disabilities become
isolated, it can be difficult for them to form a sexual relationship and start a family.
Society has moved a long way from the sexual segregation described earlier in the
long-stay hospitals, but opportunities for individuals with learning disabilities to meet
partners and form long-term relationships can still be limited. This is in spite of the
fact that individuals with learning disabilities have the same rights in law as anyone
else to marry, have a civil partnership, or live together.
If individuals with learning disabilities express a desire to marry, form a civil
partnership, or live together, care workers supporting them should discuss this with
them sensitively and seriously without imposing any of their own views. The final
decision should be down to the individuals involved.
The provision of healthcare
Individuals with learning disabilities tend to have poorer health than other people
and there is evidence that they do not always receive the same level of treatment
from the NHS as the general population. This may be because they find it difficult
to explain to a doctor or nurse what is the matter with them or because they do not
hear or understand messages about how to take care of their health. However, there
is also some evidence that they can miss out on the right level of treatment because
health professionals do not have enough training in understanding learning disabilities.
18 © LCG 2018
However, the government and other healthcare agencies, together with other
organisations supporting those with learning disabilities, are working to raise awareness
and improve the situation. Training is now given to health and medical staff in working
with individuals with learning disabilities. Personalisation of care also means that
individuals are supported to take responsibility for their own healthcare as much as
possible and supported to have regular health checks as required.
Kai’s story
Kai has moderate learning difficulties and, at 19, still lives at home with his
parents. Kai wants to be more independent. His social worker has worked
with Kai to assess his needs and identify what he would like to do. Kai is now
planning his move to supported living accommodation. He will live with four
other young people in a shared house with on-site care support. He is also
very excited about the volunteer position he has found with a local animal
rescue centre as he loves animals.
Changes in attitudes
Slowly, over the past twenty to thirty years, there have been changes in the way
society has regarded individuals with learning disabilities. This is helped by the fact
that individuals with learning disabilities have become more visible. When many lived
behind the walls of institutions, they had little contact with the community and were
largely unknown to the general population. Society knew and cared little for individuals
with learning disabilities and when it did come into contact with them, was often
afraid of them or had low expectations of them.
Stereotypes grew about individuals with learning disabilities. If they were not
regarded with fear because of what others saw as unpredictable behaviour or unusual
appearance, they might be seen as angelic or childlike and not acknowledged as
equals even if they were adults.
Changes in attitudes, supported by legislation, have meant that communities and
society are much more inclusive of individuals with learning disabilities, acknowledging
that they should be offered opportunities and services in the same way as the rest of
the population.

Positive and negative aspects of being labelled as having a
learning disability
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 8a and 8b.
There can be positive and negative aspects of being labelled as having a learning
disability.
Where individuals are labelled as having a learning disability, this can lower the
expectations of others who do not understand what learning disabilities are. The label
can also affect the self-esteem and self-confidence of the individual, especially where
they find others treat them differently because of the label. Their self-expectations may
also be lowered.
The label may lead to individuals being bullied or discriminated against and this can
also affect families of individuals who may be treated differently because they have
a family member with learning disabilities. This can cause family members to feel
ashamed or embarrassed.
Although, as you have seen, there can be negative aspects to having the label ‘learning
disabilities’, it is also important to bear in mind that there are times when obtaining a
diagnosis can be helpful, and in some cases essential.
A diagnosis can help an individual with learning disabilities if it enables them to
obtain the level of support they need; it can also help them to access funding and
accommodation. The individual’s learning disability may also be associated with
specific health conditions and in this respect, a diagnosis may help them to access
the healthcare support they need. Having a diagnostic label may also help individuals
identify others with similar issues which can lead to peer support and advocacy.
The label will also help families of individuals with learning disabilities access the
support they need in caring for the individual and to meet their own needs as carers.
Promoting positive attitudes towards individuals with
learning disabilities and their family carers
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 9.
Until recent years, positive stories about individuals with learning disabilities
were quite rare on television, radio and in newspapers. Stories about care in the
community tended to focus on what might have gone wrong and when individuals with
learning disabilities were featured, it tended to be as victims of crime or having been
ill-treated. They seldom featured as positive characters.
This is changing. Characters with learning disabilities are now featured on soaps,
such as Eastenders, and also in films and plays. Theatre and drama groups have
been founded by individuals with learning disabilities. There has been an increase in
positive representations of individuals with learning disabilities and a rise in public
awareness.
Positive stories in the media have a role to play in raising awareness of issues
connected with individuals with learning disabilities and in ensuring that their views
and stories are given the same value as others. Awareness raising and education
of the general public about learning disability is a major step in promoting positive
attitudes.
There are a number of other steps that can help to promote positive attitudes.
Better training for health and care workers will help them to model positive ways to
interact with individuals with learning disabilities when they are supporting them in the
community. Health and care workers also have a significant role to play in awareness
raising. Social care providers can help by publicising examples of good practice and
success stories.
Many organisations providing services for individuals with learning disabilities or
representing them have websites, blogs or publications which provide opportunities for
individuals to put forward their own views and to publicise positive stories and good
practice.
More and more individuals with learning disabilities are accessing social media such
as Facebook and Twitter in order to keep in touch and network with others and this
can also be an effective way to promote positive stories.
As well as promoting positive images and stories, it is important that any instances
of discrimination or bullying and harassment of individuals with learning disabilities
are challenged. Health and care workers should challenge people and practices that
are discriminatory within or outside their own organisations. This includes incidences
of discrimination, bullying or harassment towards families of individuals with learning
disabilities.

Workbook 1 21
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
The role of external agencies and others in changing
attitudes, policies and practice
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 10.
There are a wide variety of agencies and people within health and social care who
have a role in changing attitudes, policies and practice in relation to individuals with
learning disabilities.
Government agencies can pass legislation and set policies to create the framework
that enables positive attitudes, policies and practices.
Local authorities and health and social care agencies can provide the services
that are required to support individuals and ensure that individuals can access these
services.
Advocacy services can help individuals talk about their own needs and preferences
and to take an active role in their own care and in society, which helps to change
attitudes. (An advocate is someone who supports or speaks for an individual who
cannot speak for themselves.)
Support groups for individuals, their families and carers can raise awareness
in the community, challenge discrimination and find solutions to issues that stop
individuals being a part of the community.
Health and social care professionals, including care workers, social workers, GPs,
district nurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists and others, can promote inclusive
practice and challenge discrimination towards individuals with learning disabilities.
Voluntary organisations, such as Mencap and BILD, also help to increase
knowledge and awareness about learning disabilities, maintain informative websites
and publish useful leaflets and other documents.
Did you know?
Mencap is a voluntary organisation that not only provides services for individuals
with learning disabilities, but provides advice and helps to represent their
interests both locally and nationally. http://www.mencap.org.uk
BILD – British Institute of Learning Disabilities helps to train and support service
providers as well as providing a voice for individuals with learning disabilities.
http://www.bild.org.uk/
Mencap and BILD are just two examples of organisations which can be
valuable sources of advice and support both to individuals with learning
disabilities and those who support them.
22 © LCG 2018
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
Social inclusion
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 11.
Social inclusion means that individuals with learning disabilities are included as far as
they want to be in the kind of activities and services enjoyed by everyone else, rather
than being segregated. For example, this can mean that individuals are encouraged
to use the leisure and sports centres which are open to all, rather than facilities built
specifically for individuals with disabilities. Social inclusion means that individuals with
learning disabilities take a full part in society and are involved on an equal basis to
other people, ensuring they are valued.
Advocacy and self-advocacy
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 12a and 12b.
Individuals with learning disabilities - especially those with profound disabilities or with
little or no speech - may find it difficult to become involved in their care plan and for
their voices to be heard in the process, and may benefit from an advocate. Advocacy
literally means to speak for or on behalf of another person and it can be tremendously
important, particularly for an individual with severe disabilities.
Although family members may often be well-placed to act as advocate for an
individual who has learning disabilities, there are some dangers which can arise from
someone who has been so important in the individual’s past acting in this role.
Close family members may sometimes have difficulty recognising some aspects of
the individual’s character and perhaps their capacity for independence. They may
find it difficult to accept that the individual has moved on and changed and there is
a danger that it may be difficult for them to separate their own perspective or that of
the family from the individual’s best interests. For example, it may be difficult for a
family member to accept that the individual with learning disabilities is an adult and
wants the things that many adults want from life, which may include a relationship, a
job and a place of their own.
The Care Act 2014 recognises that if someone’s learning disability makes it difficult
for them to be involved in the planning or review of their care and support and they
have no family or friends to assist them, then the local authority has a duty to arrange
for an independent advocate to work with them.
Workbook 1 23
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
Self-advocacy
Self-advocacy is the ability of individuals with learning disabilities to be able to speak
up for themselves and enable themselves to have greater control over their own
lives. People First groups are examples of self-advocacy groups where individuals are
able to be supported in a variety of ways to assert their rights and to put across their
own points of view. There is a national People First group based in London and this
provides support and advice to local groups throughout the country.
Citizen or independent advocacy
This is someone who may be a volunteer or employed by an independent organisation
or agency to speak on behalf of an individual. Wherever possible, they will support
and encourage individuals to speak up for themselves. The key point about citizen
or independent advocates is their degree of independence from the provider of the
services which the individual receives. The independent advocate’s role is to support
and represent the views of the individual and this may mean that, at times, they will be
challenging the views of the providers of the service. Independent advocates can have a
vitally important role within care planning.
Government policy emphasises the importance of individuals with learning disabilities
being able to access independent advocacy services but there is a shortage of these
services.
There are two specific advocacy roles defined by law whose services individuals with
learning disabilities may require.
Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA)
The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 is described in more detail later in this section.
The MCA is designed to protect the rights of individuals who may lack capacity (ability)
to make decisions for themselves and the role of the IMCA is to learn all they can
about the individual, to represent them and to act in their best interests. They can
also do this where there is a concern that the individual may be being deprived of
their liberty in some way, for example by preventing them leaving their home without
staff support or by restricting their contact with certain people.
Independent Mental Health Advocate (IMHA)
This role relates to individuals who are being treated or restricted concerning a mental
health condition under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983. Although the
role is designed to safeguard the rights of individuals with mental health conditions,
some individuals who have a right to access an IMHA may also have learning
disabilities.

Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
Building empowerment and active participation
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 13.
It is important that individuals feel empowered and take an active part in their
everyday support.
Did you know?
Empowerment means enabling individuals to take control of their own lives.
Active participation means that individuals take an active role in their own care
rather than simply receiving services in a passive way.
There are a number of ways to build empowerment and active support into everyday
support for individuals with learning disabilities. These include:
• Practising person-centred planning which puts the individual in control of care
planning and at the centre of any decision-making.
• Supporting individuals to communicate their needs and preferences in relation to
the support they receive. For example, by using the individual’s preferred method
of communication.
• Giving individuals choices of support services and the information they need to
make decisions about support services.
• Supporting individuals to be as independent as possible and to take part
in activities and form relationships in everyday life. This would also involve
individuals building essential life skills such as cooking, personal hygiene and
cleaning around the house.
• Upholding the rights of individuals with learning disabilities and challenging any
discrimination or barriers affecting rights.
Workbook 1 25
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
Law and national policy relating to individuals with
learning disabilities
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 14.
There are a number of laws and policies that promote human rights, inclusion, equal life
chances and citizenship for individuals with learning disabilities.
The Equality Act 2010
Under the Equality Act 2010, it is unlawful to discriminate against any individual
who has one of the protected characteristics listed in the legislation. One of the
characteristics is disability and this includes learning disability. Individuals should have
equal access to public services, employment and goods and services. In everyday life,
this means that individuals with learning disabilities should not be treated differently
from anyone else when accessing services such as healthcare and education and when
they seek employment. Employers must make reasonable adjustments to the workplace
and work practices to meet individuals’ needs. Individuals and their family members
should not be discriminated against, harassed or victimised because of their disability or
association with an individual who has a disability.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission was set up as an independent
organisation with a duty to challenge discrimination and uphold equality and human
rights. It also has the power to investigate when it feels that unlawful discrimination
may be taking place.
Human Rights Act 1998
The Human Rights Act sets out the rights to which every human being is entitled. The
Act contains sixteen articles and includes the right to life, the right to freedom and to
be safe from harm, the right to fair treatment in a court of law, the right to respect for
privacy and family life, and the right to be treated with dignity and respect.
These rights seek to ensure that individuals with learning disabilities are protected
from abuse, cannot be detained against their will without good reason, have a right to
respect for their family and private life and should not be discriminated against.
26 © LCG 2018
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
The right to be treated with dignity and respect is important in everyday terms for
individuals with learning disability. It means:
to maintain dignity and self-worth
to have their cultural, ethnic, spiritual, sexual and emotional needs respected and
to receive support in meeting them
to be kept informed about what is happening with their support and care
to have access to their own doctors, dentists, opticians, local councillors and MPs
to make informed choices about all aspects of their lives
to have their care and support regularly reviewed
Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005
The MCA applies in England and Wales and is designed to protect and restore power
to individuals who have been regarded as lacking the capacity (ability) to make
decisions for themselves. Before the Act came into force, it was often assumed that
because someone had a learning disability or mental health problem, they did not
have the ability to make any key decisions for themselves. Where an individual is
unable to make decisions, an advocate will be appointed to act in their best interests.
In everyday terms, this should mean that decisions made about care and living
arrangements are made by the individual or in their best interests.
Under the MCA, everyone is assumed to have capacity unless it can be shown that they
haven’t. You should also note that an individual’s lack of capacity may be temporary or
permanent, and can vary from decision to decision.
Care Act 2014
The Care Act 2014 changed the way care was planned and provided to individuals,
and put individuals at the centre of the planning process. Care should be personcentred and personalised which, in everyday terms, means that the individual - or
their advocate - should be in control of decision-making and that the care package is
tailored to the individual according to their needs and preferences.
The Care Act also sets out the framework for how local authorities should safeguard
individuals from abuse, and the need for agencies to work together to prevent and
identify abuse and neglect. This should result in fewer cases of abuse and neglect,
and in the earlier recognition of potentially abusive situations.
Workbook 1 27

Transforming care for people with learning disabilities
- Next Steps 2015
This is the most recent government paper relating to care for individuals with learning
disabilities. It was produced jointly by the NHS, Local Government, Department
for Health and other health and social care bodies and sets out policy to improve
services for individuals with learning disabilities.
In particular, it looks at:
• empowering individuals
• providing the right care in appropriate locations
• developing and improving care workers
• the proper regulation of care
• producing data to ensure targets are met
In everyday terms, this should mean more choice in care, more say for individuals
in the type of services that are provided, better quality of care and protection from
abuse and neglect.
Promoting communication with individuals with learning
disabilities
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 15 and 16.
Individuals with learning disabilities are more likely than other people to have difficulty
communicating their ideas and needs. For some individuals, the use of accessible,
straightforward language will be sufficient to help them. For others, you may need
to adapt your communication to meet their needs. This can mean making changes
to verbal communication (using words) and non-verbal communication (e.g. body
language, facial expressions and gestures).
Non-verbal communication, such as expression and body language, is often of added
significance for individuals with learning disabilities.
You should always find out about the communication needs of the individuals you are
working with. Then you will be able to adapt communication to meet those needs.
You can make the following changes to verbal communication:
• communicating at a pace the individual can easily follow, which may mean
speaking more slowly or pausing for the individual to think about what you have
said before moving on
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
Workbook 1 29
• using short sentences and straightforward language at a suitable level for the
individual
• supporting what you are saying using pictures and appropriate non-verbal cues
(body language, facial expressions, etc)
• using sign language such as British Sign Language or Makaton (which uses a
mixture of pictures and words)
• avoid using slang, jargon and sarcasm as these can be difficult for individuals to
understand
You can make the following changes to non-verbal communication:
• pointing to pictures or objects to convey meaning
• exaggerating facial expressions
• watching for and using gestures and movement, e.g. turning towards or turning
away
• using more eye contact to convey meaning
• listening to and interpreting vocal sounds made by the individual
• using drawings, diagrams or pictures, e.g. picture exchange communication
system (PECS) where pictures are exchanged for words
Using language appropriate to age and ability
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 17.
When communicating with individuals with learning disabilities, you should choose
your words carefully and use language which the individual can easily understand.
By doing this, the individual will be more able to understand what you are saying.
However, the use of age-appropriate and respectful language is equally important
because it respects the individual’s adult status and reinforces this to others. For this
reason, never be tempted to use words such as ‘naughty’ which are associated with
children’s behaviour; or to use child versions of words such as ‘sweetie’ instead of
‘sweet’; or using the word ‘pennies’ instead of talking about money.
It is important that the language used is both appropriate to the individual’s age
and that it treats them with the dignity they deserve. Avoiding jargon and using plain
English will ensure that individuals feel they are being taken seriously and treated as
adults and equals.
Section 1: Understand the context of supporting
individuals with learning disabilities
30 © LCG 2018
Ensuring the individual has understood and dealing with
misunderstandings
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 18.
Ways to check understanding and address misunderstandings include:
• asking questions to check understanding (e.g. what time do you need to go to
lunch?) after you have told them
• asking them to repeat details back to you to ensure they understand, and
repeating what they have said back to them to ensure your own understanding
• asking if they have understood and whether there is anything that needs to be
explained further
• checking facial expressions and body language for signs of confusion
It is important that individuals feel comfortable asking questions or asking you to
repeat or explain things. You should never indicate that this is a nuisance or that they
are silly for asking.

Workbook 1 31
This section explains the importance of personalisation in social care and how it
can improve the lives of individuals with learning disabilities. You will learn about
the changes that have taken place in national policy in recent years and how
personalisation is the preferred approach to providing care and support. You will see
how changes in funding have given individuals with learning disabilities the ability to
change provider if they are not happy with the service they receive and to employ
their own staff. Finally, you will be able to see what personalisation looks like in
practice.
What personalisation is and how it can benefit individuals
with learning disabilities
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 19a, 19b and
19c.
Personalisation takes an entirely different approach to providing social care to the
traditional care model. Rather than expecting the individual to fit into a service which
has to meet the needs of several other individuals, such as a care home or day
centre, a personalised service starts by putting the needs of the individual at the
centre and designing a service with them at its heart, tailored to their needs.
A personalised approach involves giving the individual more say about the type of
service they need, how it is delivered and when they receive it.
Ideally, if they are able and willing to do so, the individual will be involved from the
earliest possible stage by contributing to an assessment of their own needs and then
being given the opportunity to make choices about:
the kind of support they need
when they receive it
who will provide it
Personalisation puts the individual in control of the service, with the aim of giving them
the service they want. If they then find that the service does not meet their needs, they
should be free to look for alternative services. A personalised approach should ensure
that the individual’s needs are met and provide a better outcome for them than a
general ‘one size fits all’ service.
Section 2: Introduction to personalisation
in social care
What might a personalised approach look like?
David’s story
David’s story illustrates the differences that can occur in the life of an
individual with learning disabilities if a personalised approach is adopted.
David has lived in a care home with five other individuals with learning
disabilities. He has a part-time job as a cleaner in a warehouse on two days
per week and attends college for a day and a half per week. He is able to
make his own way to work and to college using the bus and needs very little
support other than prompting and reassurance from the staff team at the
home. David can easily become confused by complicated ideas or if others
speak too quickly but is able to make decisions, provided he is allowed to take
his time to think about the information he is given and that ideas are broken
down into smaller, more manageable parts.
Following a person-centred review involving David, his key worker and his
family, he decided he would like to move into his own flat or to share with one
other person. Despite the best efforts of the staff at his care home to help him
be more independent, he was finding life at the home too restrictive. He had
been assessed as being able to spend time on his own, but in the care home,
there was always a member of staff present, including at night.
Having worked with David to find out how many hours of staff support
he would need, his social worker has written a support plan with David’s
involvement and has helped him to find both a flat and an agency which can
provide staff to support him for three hours per day. This is mainly to prompt
him in the mornings and help him get ready to go to college, but also to spend
some time with him, helping him manage his money and his medication.
David now shares a flat with his friend Munir. David’s social worker has found
that the service is far less expensive than his former care home placement as
he only receives help for the hours that he needs, and David appears much
happier.

Rights, choices and personalisation
Under the MCA, individuals are presumed to be able to make their own decisions,
unless it can be shown that they are unable to do so. This principle, the right to make
choices, is also at the heart of human rights legislation. The right to make informed
choices about all aspects of their lives is at the heart of the personalisation approach
to social care, in which services are designed to meet the individual’s needs and
enable them to make their own choices whenever possible.
Legislation, policies and systems that promote
personalisation
Legislation and national policy
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 20, 21a and
21b.
Since 2005, there have been a series of developments in legislation and government
policy which have introduced what has become known as the personalisation agenda
in social care.
In 2005, the government published its Green Paper Independence Well-being and
Choice. This proposed a more flexible provision of social care and use of benefit
funding, giving individuals a greater range of options and choice. Green Papers are
discussion and consultation documents issued by the government and there is no
certainty that the ideas they put forward will eventually become law.
However, most of the ideas contained in this paper were carried forward into another
government policy document, the White Paper Our Health, Our Care, Our Say, issued
in 2006. White Papers present what the government considers to be its policies, what it
would like to see happen. In this case, they set a direction for the local authority social
service departments and for the NHS, which they were expected to follow. There was a
clear expectation that personalisation would be adopted within social care.
In the following year (2007), the Department of Health followed the lead set by the
White Paper by issuing its policy document Putting People First, which promoted
personalisation with the aim of enabling ‘people to live their lives as they wish’.
Section 2: Introduction to personalisation
in social care
Workbook 1 35
From the early 1990s onwards, it was possible for local authorities to make payments
directly to individuals to enable them to arrange their own care and support. In 2008,
the Health and Social Care Act extended direct payments to individuals who did
not have the capacity to consent, which included many individuals with learning
disabilities.
The White Paper Valuing People (2001) made a significant difference to services for
individuals with learning disabilities. This set out a three-year strategy which, along
with other themes, looked at personalisation as it applied to individuals with learning
disabilities.
Personalisation as a policy was carried forward following the change of government
in 2010 and the coalition issued Caring for our future: reforming care and
support (2012). This policy document emphasised, once again, the importance
of personalisation in the government’s social care policy. This commitment to
personalised services was reaffirmed by the Health and Social Care Act 2012.
The Care Act 2014 came into force in April 2015, from which time local authorities
were required to involve the individual, their carer and others that they wished to
be involved in drawing up a care and support plan. They were also required to tell
individuals about their personal budget. Using the information about their personal
budget, the individual can ask for a direct payment to meet the needs identified in
the care and support.
The government policy paper Personalised health and care 2020: a framework
for action, published in 2014, set out the framework for personalisation of health
and social care services.
Local and national systems supporting personalisation
In order to support personalisation, new systems have been developed on a national
and local level.
Systems include:
• Personal budgets which are allocated to individuals and managed by them or
on their behalf to pay for care services that meet individual needs.
• Direct payments which are payments made direct to the individual to pay for
services.
• Multi-agency working where agencies have to work together to provide a care
plan to meet the individual’s needs.
• Person-centred planning that puts the individual at the centre of planning and
puts them in control.
• More flexible services across a wider range to ensure all needs can be met.

• Local framework agreements where local authorities have flexible agreements
with suppliers instead of block purchasing services.
• Local information and advice services so that individuals are supported to
make informed choices about care.
• Local advocacy services to support individuals in decision-making.
Did you know?
Providers of social care are expected to have policies and ways of working
which put the national policies into practice and to have their own systems to
check that they are providing a personalised service.
Personalisation and commissioning social care
The introduction of personalisation has had an impact on the process of
commissioning care services. Previously, local authorities would block purchase
services from care providers for individuals. Individuals would then be offered these
services.
With personalisation, services offered need to be more flexible and there needs to
be a wider range of services. This is to ensure that the individual can choose an
appropriate mix of services to meet their own needs.
To deal with this, local authorities use framework agreements with providers that don’t
specify the amount or type of services but simply that they may require services from
them to meet individual needs. Unfortunately, this has meant that some services
where the numbers are critical for them to survive, e.g. day care centres, have closed
down, which may lead to less choice.

Personal budgets and direct payments
Please read the following as it will help you to answer question 22.
Personal budgets
Personal or individual budgets are clearly defined amounts of money available to
support individuals’ social care needs. Under current legislation, personal budgets
should be available for anyone with social care needs. A variety of ways have been
identified to manage personal budgets.
1) The most straightforward method, for those who have the ability to manage
their own money, is to receive their personal budget as a direct payment, i.e.
a payment made to the individual. The individual can then directly control the
budget, purchasing the services they need.
2) The budget is held and managed by the local authority on behalf of the individual.
This is known as a ‘virtual budget’.
3) Alternatively, an independent organisation, for example a care agency, could
manage the budget on behalf of the individual.
4) Another variant might be for the personal budget to be managed by a carer, a
friend or a relative. In this case, an independent user-controlled trust would be
created and a trustee would be appointed to manage the personal budget.
Individual budgets clearly give the individual more control over their own care.
Whether they manage the budget themselves or it is managed on their behalf, they,
or their representatives, have the choice about how best the budget can be spent to
meet their care needs. This means the money can be directed to where the individual
needs most support.
Direct payments
It is now possible for some or all of a personal budget to be paid as a direct payment
from the local authority. This is the case for individuals with learning disabilities as
well as for other adults receiving social care services, and represents a major turning
point in terms of policy. It is a big change from the position in the past when local
authorities would only use their social care budgets to directly run their own care
homes or day centres or to pay independent organisations to do so on their behalf.
Direct payments support personalisation by putting individuals directly in control of
their budget. They can use the payment to pay for services themselves.
Section 2: Introduction to personalisation
in social care
How personalisation might result in improved services for
people with learning disabilities
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 23a, 23b and
23c.
There are many care homes for individuals with learning disabilities where the service
is excellent and delivered in a person-centred way. However, the way in which care
homes are structured can sometimes make it harder to meet needs that have been
identified, particularly where the aim is for individuals to become more independent.
Staffing patterns in care homes will usually be planned to ensure that there is a
member of staff on duty at all times, but someone who is fairly independent may only
need assistance at certain times of the day or at night in an emergency. To provide a
care home placement for someone who has the capability to be independent can be
expensive and can provide an unnecessary amount of support which can discourage
the individual from maintaining or developing their independent living skills.
Imran’s story
Imran is a British Asian with moderate learning disabilities whose family are
from Pakistan and are Punjabi speakers. Imran has close relationships with
his family, some of whom speak very little English. The agency that originally
provided his staff support could not supply staff who could speak Punjabi or
who had knowledge of his culture. Within a few months of living independently,
he had become withdrawn and had lost weight.
A person-centred review meeting was arranged, involving Imran and his family
because he felt isolated after moving from the family home to his own flat.
Although Imran speaks English as well as Punjabi, he missed the opportunity
to speak with other Punjabi speakers and he was not able to eat the food he
preferred.
As a result, he now has his personal budget paid in the form of direct
payments which are managed by his brother on his behalf. The budget is used
to employ two part-time personal assistants who can speak Punjabi and are
familiar with his culture.
Imran’s initial experience of independent living had not worked well but the
change to a personal budget enabled him and his family to employ his own
support staff to help him meet his cultural needs.

Jenny’s story
Jenny used to attend a local authority managed day centre but the number of
days allocated for her reduced over a period of time from four days per week
to just one.
Jenny has always had a problem with her weight and her doctor has advised
her that not only does she need to lose weight, but she needs to undertake
more exercise on a regular basis. She had never been very interested in
exercise but having watched the Olympics and Paralympics in 2012, she now
wants to take up cycling.
At a person-centred review meeting, it was agreed with her that, as she had
enough funds, she would purchase an adult tricycle. As her home and the day
centre are situated close to a network of off-road cycle paths, it was agreed
that the day centre staff would try to support her to go out regularly with a
member of staff.
Vacancies within the team of support staff at the day centre meant that it
proved difficult to arrange her cycle rides and, at her review meeting, her
social worker agreed that part of her personal budget would be used to hire
the services of a ‘cycle buddy’ to take her out three times each week.
Now Jenny has lost weight, is fitter and has a positive outlook. She now wants
to take part in a charity bike ride later in the year.
Knowledge Activity 2: The two stories are very different in nature but
illustrate ways in which personalised approaches can be used to support
individuals with learning disabilities.
For each of them, explain how a personalised approach has been applied and in
what ways Imran and Jenny’s lives may have been improved as a result.
40 © LCG 2018
Whatever the setting, adopting a personalised approach which fully involves the
individual in planning and decision-making should provide improved outcomes for
them. It should result in a service which is tailored to their requirements and involves
them in the everyday decisions which affect them, as well as long-term choices which
affect their future.
Personalisation and the balance of power between individuals with
learning disabilities and those who provide their support
As a result of using a personalised approach, the individual should be actively involved
in choosing and planning their care and support, which should be designed around
their own needs. Their opinion on the service they are given should be listened to and
feedback acted upon. Personal budgets and direct payments will give individuals the
power to choose their service or approach another provider if they are not happy with
the services they are receiving.
Personalisation should shift the balance of power towards the individual with learning
disabilities and away from the staff and organisations providing the service. The
individual with learning disabilities becomes the customer and it is in the interests of
staff and providers to look after their needs or run the risk that they will go to another
provider.
How personalisation is supported
Person-centred thinking, person-centred planning and person-centred approaches
support personalisation. They all involve putting the individual at the centre of the
process and looking at the whole life of an individual in a holistic way. Person-centred
planning should consider the strengths and skills of the individual, what and who is
important to them and the support they need to achieve what they want in the future.
Person-centred thinking and approaches build a profile of the individual, identify
important people, and look at support that matches their preferences and at how
decision-making can be supported.
Section 2: Introduction to personalisation
in social care
Workbook 1 41
Putting personalisation into practice
Please read the following as it will help you to answer questions 24, 25a, 25b
and 26.
Working in a personalised way to deliver health and social care or to provide brokering
services for care requires particular skills, attitudes and approaches.
Staff need to exercise a duty of care towards those they support but, at the same
time, are required to be enablers rather than simply carers. Their role is to support
individuals to make their own choices and to take as much responsibility as they are
able and willing to for their own support needs.
The social care employer-led body Skills for Care developed seven common core
principles for delivering personalised social care. Each of these principles requires a
skill, attitude and approach:
Principle 1. Enable individuals to make informed choices with regards to
the management and meeting of their personal support needs. To make an
informed choice, individuals will need to be given the information they need to make
that choice in a format they can understand and to be aware of the possible or likely
consequences of that decision. Care workers need to be able to identify relevant
information and share this with individuals to support their decision-making. They
should also have good decision-making skills themselves.
Principle 2. Enable clear and effective communication to maximise the
individual’s confidence in addressing support needs. Workers should be skilled
in identifying the individual’s preferred communication styles and in using a range of
communication methods.
Did you know?
Communication is a two-way process and it should not necessarily be
assumed that it is the individual who has communication needs; it might
be that the agency needs to communicate more effectively, for example, by
responding more appropriately to requests or making more effort to explain
things and to facilitate interpreters.
Section 2: Introduction to personalisation
in social care
42 © LCG 2018
Principle 3. Support and enable individuals to have access to appropriate
information and to consider a wide range of options for addressing their
needs. Workers should have the knowledge and skills to identify and provide
accessible information about a range of options to enable real choices to be made.
Principle 4. Support and enable individuals to develop independent selfsupport skills rather than relying on others. Approaches that enable individuals to
develop their own skills include knowing when and how to hold back and encourage
the individual to undertake tasks for themselves.
Principle 5. Support and enable individuals to use technology to address their
support needs to maximise their independence and minimise their dependence
on others. Innovations in computing and the use of smartphones have widened
the range of options available for individuals with disabilities to develop or retain
independent living skills. The challenge for support staff is to acquire basic skills and
keep them up-to-date so they can guide and support individuals in using these new or
assistive technologies.
Principle 6. Advise individuals how to gain access to support networks and
participate in the planning, development and evaluation of services. Once
again, the role of support staff is to signpost service users towards potentially helpful
groups or support networks and to know when to step back to allow the individual
to fully participate. The same principle applies to planning and evaluating the service
they receive by enabling individuals to participate as fully as they can.
Principle 7. Support and enable risk management and risk-taking to maximise
independence and choice. Staff should be able to carry out informal and formal
risk assessments with individuals and support them in managing risks, rather than
allowing the possibility of risk to unduly restrict their opportunities.
To put personalisation into practice requires skilled staff who can encourage individuals
to be as independent as possible, rather than rush in to undertake the task for them. It
requires the ability to observe, question and reflect.
On a broader level, individuals and their families may also need help in clarifying the
type of service they require and to develop a support plan to help them achieve the
outcome they desire.

Barriers to obtaining personalised services
Despite the progress that has been made with personalisation, it is important to be
aware that there are still reasons why it can be difficult for individuals with learning
disabilities to obtain personalised services. These can include:
• having limited access to information about services and how to access them
• difficulty in understanding information about personalised services
• individuals not having the range of skills or experience needed to manage and
relate to staff providing a service
• a lack of understanding on the part of agencies and workers as to what
personalisation means
• services that are still focused on medical aspects of disability rather than looking
at life choices
• limited range of services on offer in a local area
• cuts in funding that reduce the level of support available for an individual
• rules around budgets and their use may restrict who can have funding and what
for
Section 2: Introduction to personalisation
in social care
44 © LCG 2018
Overcoming the barriers
Local authorities are trying to make it easier for individuals with learning disabilities to
obtain personalised services by ensuring that more services are delivered in a personcentred way.
The law has also changed to allow personal budgets to be used more flexibly and also
to be used to purchase services which are not directly related to social care if this
meets the needs identified on the individual’s support plan. For example, by using it
to buy membership to a gym if it had been identified that the individual needed to
take more exercise.
It can help individuals to learn about the different services available to them if the
information is available in a variety of formats, for example as audio recordings,
in accessible English, via pictures and symbols, or a combination of approaches.
Individual care staff need to ensure they are knowledgeable about personalisation and
that they help the individual find suitable services to support them in their local area.
Support required to maximise the benefits of a personalised service
Personalisation is a different approach to care and individuals and their families may
need support, particularly in any transition from more traditional support.
Support may include:
• help with planning and choosing care services – individuals may not have been
involved in care or care planning before. To properly benefit, they will need to
understand the planning process and how to decide between different care
services. For example, being able to look at how different care services provide
different benefits and deciding which will be best.
• support to understand personal budgets and to manage them – individuals and
their families may need help to understand what the personal budget should be
used for and how to manage money effectively so they gain the maximum benefit
from the services they choose. For example, making sure they can pay for the
service needed on a regular basis.
• helping families adjust to the idea of the individual being more independent and
giving them information about how they can support this – families often want to
protect individuals and are reluctant to encourage independence because of the
risks it brings. Support might include, for example, carrying out a risk assessment
showing that the benefits gained are greater than the risks.
• information about services available – in order to make any decisions about the
services they want to use, individuals and their families will need information
about the sort of services that are available and the costs of these services.
